# ClaudeHopper Development Roadmap

This document outlines the development plan and progress for the ClaudeHopper tool, focusing on enhancing its capabilities for construction drawing search and analysis.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Core Text Search (Completed)
- âœ… Basic infrastructure setup
- âœ… LanceDB integration for vector storage
- âœ… PDF text extraction and chunking
- âœ… Embedding generation for text chunks
- âœ… Document metadata extraction
- âœ… Text search capabilities
  - âœ… Chunks search (specific text within documents)
  - âœ… Catalog search (document-level search)
  - âœ… Broad chunks search (search across all documents)

### Phase 2: Image Search (In Progress)
- âœ… Image search API implementation
- âœ… Configuration updates for image extraction
- âœ… Database schema for image storage
- âœ… Integration with CLIP model for text-to-image search
- ðŸ”„ Image extraction from PDFs
  - âœ… PDF page extraction logic
  - ðŸ”„ Image embedding generation
  - ðŸ”„ Metadata linking between images and source documents
- ðŸ”„ Testing with construction drawings
- â¬œ Performance optimization for large document sets

### Phase 3: Enhanced Visual Search (Planned)
- â¬œ Image-to-image similarity search
- â¬œ Object detection in construction drawings
- â¬œ Image annotation capabilities
- â¬œ Visual element recognition (symbols, dimensions, notes)
- â¬œ Advanced filtering by visual elements

### Phase 4: Integration and Advanced Features (Planned)
- â¬œ BIM integration capabilities
- â¬œ CAD file support
- â¬œ Multi-modal search (combining text and image queries)
- â¬œ Comparison tools for drawing revisions
- â¬œ Collaborative annotation features
- â¬œ UI improvements

## Current Focus

We are currently focused on completing Phase 2 by implementing and testing the image search functionality. This includes:

1. Extracting images from PDF drawings
2. Generating embeddings for these images
3. Building efficient search capabilities for finding drawings based on visual similarity
4. Testing with real construction documents

## Installation Requirements for Image Search

To enable image extraction from PDFs, ensure the following tools are installed:

- **pdfimages** utility (part of poppler-utils)
  - On macOS: `brew install poppler`
  - On Ubuntu: `apt-get install poppler-utils`

## Next Steps

1. Test image extraction with various PDF drawing types
2. Improve the text-to-image prompt quality for better search results
3. Optimize embedding storage for large document sets
4. Add sample queries and documentation for image search

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 5: Expanded Model Support and Processing Options
- â¬œ Integration with hosted models through openrouter.ai or other OpenAI-compatible services
  - Support for GPT-4V and other advanced vision models
  - Configurable API settings for different model providers
  - Cost management and optimization features
- â¬œ Reprocessing capabilities
  - Option to rerun all analysis on existing documents
  - Selective reprocessing of specific documents or drawings
  - Batch processing improvements for large document sets
  - Version control for different processing runs
